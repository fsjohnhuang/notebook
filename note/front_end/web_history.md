CERN(European Organization for Nuclear Research) is the birthplace of The World Wide Web.


HTML and WWW Inventor: Tim Berners-Lee

1940s, hypertext was established as a concept by academics.
1980s, hypertext was with the advent of the pc. 
  Bill Atkinson, came up with an application called Hypercard for the Macintosh, which enabled you to construct a series of on-screen views(called 'filing cards') that contained **textual** and **graphical** information, and users could navigate to other views by pressing on-screen **buttons**. But it just could navigate to the local views/files.

the middle 1980s, DNS came up.

HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol)
HTML(HyperText Mark-up Language, the text format for HTTP)
  base on SGML(Standard Generalized Mark-up Language), an internationally agreed upon method for marking up text into structural units.`P`,`H1` through `H6`,`OL`,`UL`,`LI` and various others are introduced from SGML.And the hypertext link by `A` anchor element with `HREF` attribute was purely Tim's invention.

1980, Tim Berners-Lee had developed his first hypertext system before coming to CERN, which was named `Enquire`.

the initial purpose of HTML was that could be cross-reference from one research pager to another, far from simply making available a large number of research documents as files that could be downloaded to individual computers.

1989, Tim's prototype Web browser on the NeXT computer came out.
  HTML didn't contain IMG tag at that time.

September 1991, HTML was discussed on a kind of electronic discussion group in which enthusiacts could exchange ideals and gossip which called WWW-talk.
1992, Dave Raggett composed the HTML+, a richer version of the original HTML.
December 1992, Marc Andreessen implemented the `IMG` tag in the form suggested by the Mosaic team on its browser.

April 1993, the Mosaic browser was released, which support `IMG` and other extensions base on Tim's version of HTML.

July 1994, Dan Connolly published a Document Type Definition for HTML 2, a kind of mathematically precise description of the language.

1995, HTML is extended with many new tags.
  `BGCOLOR`,`FONT FACE` etc. which control stylistic aspects of a document and other new tags had be emerged. Some academics protested that tags belongs to stylistic aspects is outside the scope of HTML.

March 1995, Dave Roggett published HTML 3 as an Internet Draft.
  introduced `FIG` to replace `IMG` tag, and `TABLE`,`TAB`, `FOOTNOTE` ,`FORM` and `STYLE` tags, and `class` attribute.
  but this draft did not ratify by IETF, because of too large and too full to new proposals.
  The `TABLE` tags finally surfaced from the HTML 3 draft to appear in HTML 3.2 .

September 1995, Netscape submits a proposal for frames.

November 1995, Style sheets for HTML documents begin to take shape.

April 1996,  a W3 working draft on the subject of scripting was written by Dave Roggett.

HTML ERB became the HTML Working Group

December 1996, HTML4(named Cougar) came up.
  supported form extensions, style sheet, scripting and much more.

January 1997, HTML3.2 is ready.
  included tables, applets, text flow around images, subscript and superscripts.

Spring 1998, HTML 4 had implemented by vendors.


1994, Hakon Lie published the first draft of Cascading HTML Style Sheets.

1996.11, CSS1.0 was published by Hakon Lie and Bert Bos which is base on Hakon Lie's resolution.
CSS1.2

before 1997, CSS was not supported by browser.
IE3 started to support CSS, although it was suck.
Netscape 4 started to support CSS.
  far from implemented CSS directly, Netscape translate CSS into JavaScript and extended some JavaScript API to control the styles.

1998.5, CSS2.0

2000.3，implemented by browser completely.
2000, IE 5.5 supported CSS1 completely.

CSS3, 分模块

IE 3 supported JavaScript by JScript.
